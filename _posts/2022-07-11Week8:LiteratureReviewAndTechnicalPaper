In our literature review and technical paper, we were able to explore elements of storytelling through data visualization, look at best practices, and develop and design the features
we would build in our own visualization if we had more time.

We chose to do a literature review as our technical paper, because fully conducting research on a data visualization that we coded ended up being too broad a scope to accomplish this 
summer. Insetead, we opted to design what features we would have made, based on our literature review, exploration of the data, and information we learned about the issue of irresponsible
AI this summer.

A big part of the technical paper was developing clarity around the process of data visualization research, and building that process into the structure of our technical paper. We 
developed the following flow chart, which we later refined:
