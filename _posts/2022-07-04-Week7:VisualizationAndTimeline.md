**Timeline Visualization Creation**

One of the user scenarios we generated for our research question was for a hypothetical phd student who wants to be able to sort the data by date and see the ai
instances organized into a timeline. This user wants to be able to see and compare the date of the instance and the date the public found out about the instance on the same graph. For some of these, they will be the same, as when a user notices the problem immediately when they use the tool, and this knowledge quickly spreads through the general public. Sometimes there will be more of a gap between the two dates. For example, when users' data is being collected and used for nefarious purposes, people may not realize this is happening until much damage has been caused.

A more specific user scenario we came up with was that the phd student wanted to be able to sort by periods of time so that she could see any trends for when certain political parties were in power, versus others. While we don't know whether there would be any significant trends in this scenario, articulating the user's desire helps us to build specific, completable features in our data visualization.

Here, I am embedding an entire notebook with various experiments, some moderately successful, and some unsuccessful. I hope this gives you a window into what my work looked like as I was learning to use observable. In the text after the following embedding, I will break down some of what I learned in these experiments.
