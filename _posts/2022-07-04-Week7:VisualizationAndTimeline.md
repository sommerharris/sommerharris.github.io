**Timeline Visualization Creation**

One of the user scenarios we generated for our research question was for a hypothetical phd student who wants to be able to sort the data by date and see the ai
instances organized into a timeline. This user wants to be able to see and compare the date of the instance and the date the public found out about the instance on the same graph. For some of these, they will be the same, as when a user notices the problem immediately when they use the tool, and this knowledge quickly spreads through the general public. Sometimes there will be more of a gap between the two dates. For example, when users' data is being collected and used for nefarious purposes, people may not realize this is happening until much damage has been caused.
