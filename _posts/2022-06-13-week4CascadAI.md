Reflections from the Cascad.ai conference

-the importance of people having a seat at the table for the human rights conversations related to AI without needing to understand the technical context of how AI works, the need for technological review boards (similar to transportation or medical review boards)

-acknowledging that we are all technological citizens and that technology does not happen in a vacuum.

-how important it is for human actors to be responsible for the AI they create rather than falsely attributing the capacity for moral/ethical reasoning to AI

-the importance of ultimately giving the doman expert flexibility and power on how the information they are analyzing is displayed
